// Historically, Crochet assumed that all declarations were ordered.
// This means that dispatch was resolved at the point new branches
// were added, which was fine then. But with placeholder types, this
// is now wrong. If you define a command over yet-to-be-defined types
// and then define a hierarchy later, the command's dispatch would not
// be resolved again.
