% crochet

// Crochet allows both interpolated text and trivial text. Because of how
// PEG works, interpolated text that fails to parse will cause the parser
// to later try parsing it as a trivial text. We should make sure that this
// cannot succeed if the piece of text has interpolation holes in it.
