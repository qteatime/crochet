# Packages

A simple form of packages with hierarchical, static capabilities
can be defined as such:

  - each package defines what its sources are
  - what packages it depends on
    - possibly restricting what capabilities it confers them
  - what are the capabilities it requires to run
  - and what additional capabilities it provides

When loading a package we check if the union of the capabilities
it provides and requires is a subset of the the currently afforded
capabilities, and we reject loading otherwise.

This means that a package must require a superset of the capabilities
its dependencies do.
