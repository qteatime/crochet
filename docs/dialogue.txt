Dialogue system
===============

The dialogue system is based on a small algebra for flow-layouting with some
interaction semantics sprinkled on top. We want a more flexible flow-layouting
semantics rather than a pure text-based one so dialogues can embed pauses,
skips, and images in a principled manner.


## The language

We use the following abstract language:

  t in text
  n in name
  i in number
  b in boolean

  expr e ::
    e e                           -- flow concatenation
    n(e ...)                      -- application
    n                             -- load
    e.n                           -- projection
    t | i | b                     -- primitives


## The algebra

The following algebra is used for the runtime:

  Element e ::
    Text t                    -- primitive text
    Concatenate e e           -- flow concatenation
    Pause n                   -- pauses for N time portions (N must be time-typed)
    Wait                      -- pauses until the player interacts to continue


## Interpretation

We want to support a system where the user can decide how fast the text is
displayed (in a letter-by-letter typing), as well as that can support pauses
in this display.
