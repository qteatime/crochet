The `Mime Types` package provides a small database mapping mime types to
extensions. This is useful for anything dealing with binary data along
with a file extension.

The database is based on [link:http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types | Apache Foundation's httpd mime types list].
